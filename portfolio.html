    <h3>brainstorm</h3>

    <p>Brainstorm is an ongoing project where I look into the specifics of the fashion industry. In this day and age it feels like fashion is always being repeated and everything looks the same. Using elements of recognizable brands, I create shoes to show that the industry is somewhat boring.</p>

  <p>The beginning concept when I was doing these pieces was that I wanted to create a surreal looking environment while taking inspiration from Japan, Nintendo, and older movies. I used Photoshop to compile images together then used the image trace in illustrator. I used the high fidelity option.

<h3>error in code</h3>

<p>I wanted to blend the natural form of an animal with robot forms as well as a human element when making this piece. I also used the sound editor to glitch this photo and it came out in a very muted color and has fragments that are not seen in the before photo and is the reason why this piece is called error in code.

<h3>dead or alive</h3>

    <center><p>web</center><p>
<p>Although the title can seem extreme for what the website is, this piece is called dead or alive because overthinking has always been a serious problem for me. The twisted thing about struggling through this is that every time I think that I'm overthinking I'll tend to overthink more just based on overthinking. That is a very confusing sentence to say the least, but it sums up my feelings about overthinking.

<p>The concept of this website is that you have to be careful on the internet. Although this is a very basic concept, this website uses both PSA elements as well as puzzle elements to make the website interactive in a fun way (hopefully). Browsing the internet safely is very important in order to make sure your personal information does not get leaked among other bad things.
