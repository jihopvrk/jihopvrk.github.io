<h3>1/100</h3>
<p>The movements of a painter are often described as calming or therapeutic.  When my friend Nam was entered into the world record attempt for most collaborative artists working on a mural in Downtown San Jose, I saw it as a good opportunity to highlight these movements. I used a myriad of bright colors to then compliment these movements.</p>

    <h3>i'm sorry</h3>

    <p>Iâ€™m sorry is a piece where conversation is thought about into a deeper context. Usually nowadays when people communicate with each other over text, many take the abbreviated forms of words in order to make their experience faster. However, focusing on the words in between the lines is what I wanted to portray through this piece.

  <h3>*one**</h3>
  <p>Men discussing their feelings has been a very obscure scene to imagine. Due to gender roles and societal standards men are somewhat forced to be a strong mucho man all the time no matter the situations. In this piece I wanted to contrast the feelings of overwhelmed as well as relief and how they need each other to exist.

<h3>w a v e s</h3>
<p>This piece is either supposed to make you feel anxious or peaceful. You can decide which one. (should be mentioned this is a projection piece)

<h3>cold</h3>
<p>When one thinks of weather, certain moods and aesthetics are associated depending on which type of weather one experiences. In this piece I wanted to make rain seem much more emotionally intense by making the piece monochromatic and using different angles to highlight the shots.
