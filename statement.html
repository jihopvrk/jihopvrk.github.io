<center>I primarily identify myself as a digital media artist, especially in the area of cinematography. Although I believe that a true artist should not limit themselves to certain mediums, I find a lot of comfort in technology and using technology to develop my art. I grew up using a lot of technology due to my parents and they have helped me because familiar with it. I am also into sculpture and would like to develop my skills in that particular medium soon. I like to switch mediums frequently because I like expressing myself in different ways.<br>
<br />
I never imagined myself becoming an artist. I always had an interest in art but did not know where to start. However, I realized that there was only one thing in art that interested me: the aesthetics. I always believed that the way I go about life was always affected by the looks of things. I always keep my room as tidy as possible among other actions that help me sustain this type of lifestyle. Whether it be a website, video, or photography, I always ponder hardest on the aesthetics of the work. I truly weigh aesthetics over meaning a lot of the times and I will most likely continue to do so.
